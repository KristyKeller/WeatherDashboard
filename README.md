## Application 
A weather dashboard that allows the user to search for a city that is then displayed to his or her search history. Current and future weather forecast are presented through a 5-day forcast. For each day, the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index is given. The UV index is assigned a color that showcases whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
