```
As A traveler
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
So that I can plan a trip accordingly

## Application Description 
A weather dashboard that allows the user to search for a city that is then displayed to his or her search history. Current and future weather forecasts are presented through a 5-day forecast. Each day has the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. The UV index is assigned a color that showcases whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. The user can navigate using previously searched cities via the search history list.
